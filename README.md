# TheCheezyMaze

A mobile puzzle game only on Android. You control a mouse through the stage to collect all of the cheese before time expires. Be careful though, there are mousetraps hiding around the corner.

I always wondered how video games were made. I started reading and researching which led me to Unity and C#. After spending a couple of months learning C# and following tutorials, I thought it was time to start my own project to see how much I really learned and if I could do it. This is the result and I learned quickly that programming is a huge interest to me!

I designed this game in Unity and wrote it in C#. The real problem came when I needed assets in the game. That's when I started to learn about Blender. I used Blender to create and animate all of the assets. That was also an interesting experience where I learned a lot, but programming ended up being what I enjoyed the most. Here are some images from the game:
